                  they’ll naturally want to retain you. If you have the opportunity to gain expertise in an area vital
                  to the business, seize it. Go above and beyond to exceed expectations on a daily basis and show that

                <p class="govuk-body">As an employer, one of your priorities will be making sure that your team is as
                  productive as possible in helping you achieve your company’s goals. But sometimes an employee may
                  develop a theme of poor timekeeping and absence.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">While there may be many justifiable reasons for poor punctuality and excessive
                  sick days, it’s down to you and your employee to resolve any underlying issues to ensure that the
                  business doesn’t take a hit over the lack of productivity that tardiness leads to.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The importance of punctuality is even more imperative in customer-facing
                  businesses, where workers need to be present to serve shoppers in specific timeframes or else the
                  customer experience will suffer.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">While the 21st Century has seen something of a shift towards more flexible working
                  hours in many offices, there are still countless environments where it’s impossible to be so lax with
                  timing – and in these cases, the offending employee would need to be approached about their behavior
                  accordingly.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Remember that your employee is human, and as such will have innumerable concerns,
                  distractions and motivations at play under the skin. Perhaps their absenteeism is down to relationship
                  troubles or a long-term family illness? Plenty of companies encourage their workers to leave their
                  problems at the door when they enter the workplace, but sometimes a member of staff will feel overawed
                  and unable to maintain their focus. 228/400 words</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">Communication is the key to success – humans are social animals designed to thrive
                  in collaborative circumstances. However, some of us are more adept at communicating than others and
                  it’s the failure to share thoughts, ideas and feelings effectively which can lead to uncomfortable
                  situations.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Creating and maintaining teams within a working situation can be key to the
                  success of a business. Bringing a diverse group of people together to work towards a common goal, for
                  example increasing sales outcomes, ensures that different ideas and approaches to reaching the desired
                  outcome can be evaluated and implemented. At least that’s the idea!</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The reality can be that often one or two individuals can dominate a group and
                  effectively override everyone else, so it’s beholden on those managing teams to ensure this is not
                  allowed to happen.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Is it a good idea to have people of varying temperaments, abilities and views in
                  one team? Of course it is, because without disagreements there’d be no discussions and without
                  discussions nothing could ever change.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Taking extremes of homogenised teams: a team comprised solely of risk takers could
                  potentially gamble the future success of the business by always insisting the riskiest approaches are

                  work and experience at firsthand how the theory and principles of their discipline are applied. The
                  key learning aims in practical classes (Allison, 1995) are:
                  • Consolidate subject knowledge • Introduce disciplinary methods and procedures • Develop technical
                  skills • Develop cognitative skills • Promote teamwork skills • Increase motivation

                <p class="govuk-body">The benefits of hands-on learning, or practical learning, is particularly
                  beneficial for STEM subjects as they bring complex concepts to life so they can better retain learned
                  information. According to The Edvocate, “The processes of inquiry, reasoning and collaboration
                  required in STEM learning are similar to any experiential activity; learning activities must be
                  hands-on experiences.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">STEM classes also demand rigor and relevance in a curriculum, and the students who
                  take these classes must learn to think critically as they use science, technology, engineering, and
                  mathematics to solve real world problems through direct learning experiences.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Students become more engaged and are more likely to remember the information they
                  have learned due to their experience. Rather than just reading and memorising from a textbook, which
                  can leave many students demotivated and cause them to lose interest, hands-on learning stimulates
                  their senses and enables them to become more connected to their learning.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">When they work on real-life projects, students can see the impact of their work,
                  learning important skills along the way. For example, they learn collaborative and critical thinking
                  skills during hands-on learning activities, which are essential for the workplace. It prepares them
                  better for life after graduation, equipping them with job-ready skills and the required academic
                  knowledge. Hands-on learning is, after all, the practical application of academic knowledge. It means
                  students get to visualise, experience and learn by doing. 399/400 words</p>
