                <p class="govuk-body">When you apply for a job, you often submit a resume and cover letter to outline
                  your previous experiences that make you qualified for the position. When you get to the interview,
                  your prospective employer has likely already reviewed your application materials and is familiar with
                  your background. Interviewers may ask you to describe your work experience, which gives you the chance
                  to share what you feel is most valuable to this new role.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Any job has a set of duties you’ll be responsible for, so knowing your prior
                  experience can help your interviewer gauge how prepared you are for a role. Even though they can see
                  your experience on your resume or application, your ability to summarize your work history and relate
                  it to the position can show that you’ve reflected on your potential employer’s expectations.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">This interview prompt gives you the chance to summarize the education and training
                  that make you the most qualified candidate for the role. You can use this time to present the items on
                  your resume more clearly in terms of how they prepare you for this position’s responsibilities and
                  contributions to the company’s goals. Before your interview, consider writing out quick talking points
                  to organize your thoughts, and use the following steps to help prepare your answer.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Familiarize yourself with the position’s expectations to best present your ability
                  to handle its responsibilities. Briefly outline what the role entails, including the daily tasks,
                  necessary skills and ideal goals. You should also identify the tools listed in the job description,
                  such as specific technology or equipment. Recalling the required and preferred qualifications can help
                  you determine which of your skills and experiences to discuss.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">It’s wise to remind yourself of the professional experience you provided during
                  the application process so you know what expectations you have set for the interviewer. Study the most
                  relevant experiences on your resume, cover letter and formal application, and focus on the duties,
                  skills and accomplishments of each. Use the terminology you gathered from the job listing to phrase
                  your experiences in terms the interviewer is likely to recognize. This step can help you optimize your
                  brief summary and focus your answer. 362/400 words</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">The thing is, you’re feeling a little restless lately. Perhaps you know your job
                  so well that you could do it in your sleep. Or maybe you don’t see much opportunity for growth or
                  movementin your department. That little voice in your head is saying it’s ready for new challenges,
                  but the thought of leaving your awesome company is really daunting. There’s got to be a better way,
                  right?</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Before you start polishing up your resume, it’s worth thinking about how you can
                  create your own opportunity at your current company. But how do you do this? Where do you start? How

                <p class="govuk-body">As an employer, one of your priorities will be making sure that your team is as
                  productive as possible in helping you achieve your company’s goals. But sometimes an employee may
                  develop a theme of poor timekeeping and absence.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">While there may be many justifiable reasons for poor punctuality and excessive
                  sick days, it’s down to you and your employee to resolve any underlying issues to ensure that the
                  business doesn’t take a hit over the lack of productivity that tardiness leads to.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The importance of punctuality is even more imperative in customer-facing
                  businesses, where workers need to be present to serve shoppers in specific timeframes or else the
                  customer experience will suffer.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">While the 21st Century has seen something of a shift towards more flexible working
                  hours in many offices, there are still countless environments where it’s impossible to be so lax with
                  timing – and in these cases, the offending employee would need to be approached about their behavior
                  accordingly.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Remember that your employee is human, and as such will have innumerable concerns,
                  distractions and motivations at play under the skin. Perhaps their absenteeism is down to relationship
                  troubles or a long-term family illness? Plenty of companies encourage their workers to leave their
                  problems at the door when they enter the workplace, but sometimes a member of staff will feel overawed
                  and unable to maintain their focus. 228/400 words</p>

                  in collaborative circumstances. However, some of us are more adept at communicating than others and
                  it’s the failure to share thoughts, ideas and feelings effectively which can lead to uncomfortable
                  situations.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Creating and maintaining teams within a working situation can be key to the
                  success of a business. Bringing a diverse group of people together to work towards a common goal, for
                  example increasing sales outcomes, ensures that different ideas and approaches to reaching the desired
                  outcome can be evaluated and implemented. At least that’s the idea!</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The reality can be that often one or two individuals can dominate a group and

                <p class="govuk-body">The general aim for practical classes is to enhance students’ understanding of
                  methods of scientific enquiry. This is pursued in a variety of ways where students are given the
                  opportunity to undertake experiments; tackle problem-solving exercises; carry out survey and project
                  work and experience at firsthand how the theory and principles of their discipline are applied. The
                  key learning aims in practical classes (Allison, 1995) are:
                  • Consolidate subject knowledge • Introduce disciplinary methods and procedures • Develop technical

                <p class="govuk-body">The benefits of hands-on learning, or practical learning, is particularly
                  beneficial for STEM subjects as they bring complex concepts to life so they can better retain learned
                  information. According to The Edvocate, “The processes of inquiry, reasoning and collaboration
                  required in STEM learning are similar to any experiential activity; learning activities must be
                  hands-on experiences.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">STEM classes also demand rigor and relevance in a curriculum, and the students who
                  take these classes must learn to think critically as they use science, technology, engineering, and
                  mathematics to solve real world problems through direct learning experiences.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Students become more engaged and are more likely to remember the information they
                  have learned due to their experience. Rather than just reading and memorising from a textbook, which
                  can leave many students demotivated and cause them to lose interest, hands-on learning stimulates
                  their senses and enables them to become more connected to their learning.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">When they work on real-life projects, students can see the impact of their work,
                  learning important skills along the way. For example, they learn collaborative and critical thinking
                  skills during hands-on learning activities, which are essential for the workplace. It prepares them
                  better for life after graduation, equipping them with job-ready skills and the required academic
                  knowledge. Hands-on learning is, after all, the practical application of academic knowledge. It means
                  students get to visualise, experience and learn by doing. 399/400 words</p>
