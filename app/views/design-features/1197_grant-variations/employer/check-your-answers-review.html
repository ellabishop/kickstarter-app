                  <p class="govuk-body">The thing is, you’re feeling a little restless lately. Perhaps you know your job so well that you could do it in your sleep. Or maybe you don’t see much opportunity for growth or movementin your department. That little voice in your head is saying it’s ready for new challenges, but the thought of leaving your awesome company is really daunting. There’s got to be a better way, right?</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Before you start polishing up your resume, it’s worth thinking about how you can create your own opportunity at your current company. But how do you do this? Where do you start? How do you even get the right people to listen to you? Read on for five easy steps for creating a new job at your current company.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Also, don’t be afraid to ask your supervisor to punch holes in this idea; you’ll want to be prepared to answer challenging questions if your idea gets to the next level. If your supervisor agrees that your idea could work, then ask about the next step—i.e., the right people to talk to in order to make the job a reality. </p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">No matter what, again you’ll want to focus on how this new role will be a great thing for the company—and why you’re exactly the right person to take it on. 241/300 words</p>

                  <p class="govuk-body">As an employer, one of your priorities will be making sure that your team is as productive as possible in helping you achieve your company’s goals. But sometimes an employee may develop a theme of poor timekeeping and absence.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">While there may be many justifiable reasons for poor punctuality and excessive sick days, it’s down to you and your employee to resolve any underlying issues to ensure that the business doesn’t take a hit over the lack of productivity that tardiness leads to.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">The importance of punctuality is even more imperative in customer-facing businesses, where workers need to be present to serve shoppers in specific timeframes or else the customer experience will suffer.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">While the 21st Century has seen something of a shift towards more flexible working hours in many offices, there are still countless environments where it’s impossible to be so lax with timing – and in these cases, the offending employee would need to be approached about their behavior accordingly.</p>
                  <p class="govuk-body">Remember that your employee is human, and as such will have innumerable concerns, distractions and motivations at play under the skin. Perhaps their absenteeism is down to relationship troubles or a long-term family illness? Plenty of companies encourage their workers to leave their problems at the door when they enter the workplace, but sometimes a member of staff will feel overawed and unable to maintain their focus. 228/400 words</p>
