          <p class="govuk-body">Young people need support so that they are in a better position to find work in the
            future.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">By creating a Kickstart Scheme job you are helping young people who are at risk of being
            unemployed in the long term.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">The Kickstart Scheme job should help them get basic work skills. This includes: </p>

            <li>CV and interviews</li>
            <li>looking for long term work</li>

          <p class="govuk-body">You need to offer support so they are employable by you or other organisations. You can
            also work with other organisations to provide this employability support on your behalf.</p>
