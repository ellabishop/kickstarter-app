        17 December 2021 which covers:</p>

            href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Living Wage</a> depending on the age of the

      <p class="govuk-body">Employers can spread the job start dates up until 31 March 2022. They’ll get funding for 6
        months once the young person has started their job.</p>

      <h3 id="what-get" class="govuk-heading-s">What you'll get</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get an initial payment of £1,860. This includes:</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">£360 per job for admin costs</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Kickstart gateways will get £360 for each job to contribute towards admin costs. You may

      <p class="govuk-body">This will be paid to you and you will need to pay this to the employer (as well as an extra
        £60 if you do not pay VAT).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This funding should be spent on setup costs and supporting the young person to develop their
        employability skills. Employers can choose to get someone else to do this for them, such as a Kickstart gateway
        or a service provider. If they choose to do this they will have to agree how to share the £1,500.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The employer should use this funding for:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>training and employability support (provided by the employer, Kickstart gateway or another provider)</li>
        <li>IT equipment and software</li>

      </h2>

      <p>As a Kickstart gateway, you act as an intermediary to help an employer get a Kickstart Scheme grant. You may
        also offer employability support to the young person on the scheme.</p>
      <p>You should already have a Kickstart Scheme grant agreement. You can <a

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Essential responsibilities</h3>

      <p>As a Kickstart gateway with an existing grant agreement with DWP, you need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>ensure the employer has the capacity and capability to support the Kickstart Scheme workers</li>
        <li>gather information from the employer about the jobs</li>

      <p>You may choose to offer employability support to the young person on behalf of the employer.</p>

      <p>This can include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sharing your expertise with the employers to help them onboard and train young people employed through the

      <p>A Gateway Plus is a specific type of Kickstart gateway. They can help smaller organisations, such as sole
        traders and partnerships, apply for a Kickstart Scheme grant.</p>

      <p>Alongside the essential responsibilities of a Kickstart gateway, they will also:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>add the young person to their organisation’s payroll</li>
        <li>pay the young person’s wages on the small employer’s behalf using the funding from DWP</li>
        <li>provide the employability support on the small employer’s behalf</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Organisations that are approved to act as a Gateway Plus are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        employers to your grant agreement (grant variation)</h2>

      <p>You can add employers or jobs to your grant agreement with DWP until midday on 17 December 2021. This is called
        a ‘grant variation’.</p>

      <p>The new jobs or employers will be assessed to make sure they meet the <a

      <h3 id="criteria" class="govuk-heading-s">Job criteria</h3>

      <p>The jobs created with Kickstart Scheme funding must be new jobs. You need to check all of this with the
        employers you represent.</p>

      <p>The jobs must not:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>replace existing or planned vacancies</li>
        <li>cause existing employees, apprentices or contractors to lose work or reduce their working hours</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The jobs must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be a minimum of 25 hours per week, for 6 months</li>
        <li>pay at least the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates/"> National Minimum
            Wage or the National Living Wage</a> for the employee’s age group</li>
        <li>only require basic training</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each job needs to help the young person become more employable. The Kickstart gateway needs to agree with the
        employer how this is done.</p>

      <p>This employability support could include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>looking for long-term work, including career advice and setting goals
          support with CV and interview preparations
        </li>
        <li>developing their skills in the workplace</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the employer is not eligible for Kickstart Scheme funding, they can <a
          href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/kickstart-scheme-for-gateways#other-schemes">find out about other employment
          schemes</a>.

      <h3 id="emp-needs" class="govuk-heading-s">What the employer needs to give you</h3>

      <p>They’ll need to give you:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>their Companies House reference number, Charity Commission number or Office of the Scottish Charity
          Regulator number, if they have one</li>
        <li>their organisation’s address and contact details</li>
        <li>details of the jobs and their location</li>

        <li>how the young person can provide feedback during their job and afterwards, and how this will be acted on

      <p>We provide <a href="kickstart-scheme-for-gateways#what-get">funding per

        You or the employer can advertise vacancies, but all jobs must receive an introduction through a DWP work coach
        to receive full funding.
      </div>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If a young person leaves the job early</h3>

      <p>You must email DWP as soon as possible if the young person:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>leaves their job before the end of the 6-month period</li>
        <li>needs to temporarily leave their job (for example for special leave or COVID-19-related restrictions)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The email address is the same one you use to tell DWP about the young person’s start date. You’ll be told how
        to do this in the ‘referral’ email you get when a work coach refers a young person to a job vacancy.</p>
      <p>If they leave their job early, DWP will pay the grant until the end of the month that they stopped working.</p>
      <p>DWP may be able to extend the funding period if the young person has to temporarily stop working.</p>

      <h2 id="manage-funding" class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27">Manage the Kickstart Scheme funding</h2>

      <p>DWP will send the funding to you as the Kickstart gateway. You will be responsible for sending the funding to
        the employer within 5 working days.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How the funding is calculated for each young person</h3>

      <p>The calculation is:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>25 hours each week at National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage (depending on their age at the end of
          the job*) multiplied by 26 weeks</li>
        <li>National Insurance and workplace pension contributions are added to this amount</li>
        <li>the £1,500 funding for setup costs is then added to this amount</li>
      </ul>

      <p>*For example, if a young person starts the job aged 17 and turns 18 before the end of the 26 weeks, the funding
        will cover National Minimum Wage for 18 year olds from the first day of their job.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">£1,860 per job</h3>

      <p>You should inform DWP as soon as possible or by 11:59pm on 30 April 2022 that the young person has started the
        job. The <a href="kickstart-scheme-for-gateways#what-get">£1,500 setup costs and
          £360
          admin costs funding</a> will then be paid. You’ll be told how to do this in the
        email you receive when a work coach refers a young person to a vacancy.</p>

      <p>If the Kickstart gateway or another provider does some of the job setup and employability support, the employer
        can use the £1,500 funding to cover this.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Kickstart Scheme wages and related costs</h3>

      <p>
        Every 30 days we use information from HMRC to check that the young person is being paid through Pay As You Earn
        (PAYE).
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll then send the funding for the wages and related costs to cover the last 30 days of employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The employer can pay a higher wage and for more hours but the funding will not cover this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time you’ll receive a remittance advice explaining what you’ve got. You’ll be able to identify the young
        person in the remittance advice by their ‘Introduction ID’. We’ll send the Introduction ID in an email when the
        young person is referred by a work coach to the job.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Funding schedule</h3>

      <p>The schedule shows when the funding will be sent to you. You then need to send it to the employer within 5
        working days.</p>
