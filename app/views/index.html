          There was an issue whereby employers who had previously applied under a gateway organisation were applying for additional jobs (called a variation) but using their gateway's Kickstart ID in the application process, instead of either going through their gateway or, submitting a new application themselves. This work discourages them from going down this route. Note that we don't have any validation on the service so we can't wholly prevent this from happening. </li>

The latest prototype is where we got to before we stopped working on it.
