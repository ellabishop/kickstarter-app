      <p class="govuk-body">All Kickstart Scheme job placements must be:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>6 months</li>
        <li>at least 25 hours per week</li>
        <li>paying at least the National Minimum Wage (or the National Living Wage depending on the age of the participant) through PAYE</li>
        <li>paying the statutory employer duties for the health, safety and welfare for young people, National Insurance and pension contributions</li>
        <li>including support for young people to help them get work after they finish their Kickstart Scheme job</li>


      </ul>


<p class="govuk-body">You will need to make adjustments to your job placements so they meet the criteria before you apply.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Once a participant has completed their 6 month job placement, you can offer them further employment but this will not be funded by the Kickstart Scheme.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The job placement can then be taken up by a second person.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Kickstart is not an apprenticeship, but participants may move onto an apprenticeship at any time during, or after their job placement.</p>
