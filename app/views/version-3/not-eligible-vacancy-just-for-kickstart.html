      <p class="govuk-body">In order to apply to the Kickstart Scheme, your job placements must:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be funded by the Kickstart Scheme grant and would not exist without this funding</li>
<li>be paid from the grant money for the 25 hours per week on National Minimum Wage (employers can pay a higher wage and pay for more hours)</li>
<li>not replace your existing or planned jobs</li>
<li>not cause existing employees or contractors to lose or reduce their employment</li>
      </ul>


<p class="govuk-body">You will need to make adjustments to your job placements so they meet the criteria before you apply.</p>
